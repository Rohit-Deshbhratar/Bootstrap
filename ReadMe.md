This example shows how to use .cols-*-* & .col and it's working. Also shows us that how much space a column takes.

### grid-classes.html
This example shows working of col-sm|md|lg and their breakpoints. We also learned that when col-sm|md|lg met their respective breakpoint columns turns into rows.

### grid-without-classes.html
In this example we have only used .col class, Which divides the grid for columns as per requirement. We learned that only on .col in a row occupy entire row, whereas for multiple .col in a row spaces are divides equally.
If .col used with sm|md|lg| it becomes responsive.
NOTE: .col will only maintain equal spacing deosn't matter what breakpoint is.
